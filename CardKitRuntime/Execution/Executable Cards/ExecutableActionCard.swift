/// be subclassed. Subclasses must override the main() method to provide their executable functioanlity.
/// This method will be called on a background thread so operations used by this method may block if desired,
/// without blocking the main app thread. This method may also spawn additional background threads, e.g.
/// using dispatch_async(). However, upon return of main(), the ExecutionEngine will consider this card
/// as having finished its execution. Therefore, you may need to block returning until background threads have
/// completed executing, e.g. using dispatch_semaphore_wait or dispatch_group_wait or other mechanics.
